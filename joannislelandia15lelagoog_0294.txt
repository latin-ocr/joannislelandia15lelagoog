Most Ηοιιι Sir,

HAvtng the opportunityo ιιιιι bearet Μι. ΡιιιίιιιΥοιιιις,
lpresnmc to trouble you. (as (Ι hove done so often
with' impunity that Ι begin to thinks may doit Iawsnll y.)
Mr Pocock intends shortly to publish some picces os Mai ι
monrdes tn Arabrck wrth ιιιι ιιιιιιιιιιοιι For my sels Ihave ¹
engaged ι matter os nscore os our ablest men in ιιιιι kind, ι
to undertakeathorough Surveyo our Pnhhck Library ιιι· j
tending to makea perse& Cntalogne os all the books accord·

that’s done ιο incorporate in it als the Αιιιιι οιι in any οι our p
prruate college Libraries, which ate wanting in the Publick,
so asne that desrres to knoW, moysee at one ιειι, what
we have upon any subject Dr. james made some beginning ι
in this kind; but none yet has ventur'd either ιο perse& his '

ley requires a single mansor the placet and my thoughts
staverun much upon Mt. Young. Is the eiedion be sest to
the Universtty‚ ipre sume, he might with casei (is hc would ¹
he wiking to accept os it) obtain the place. But 1 find him
not inelinable However, Sir, Ι thought fitt to give yow
thus much notice, asos a thing, in which your are not un·
concetn'd: (sor Ι cannot think but yow paffionately affett
the prosperity os ιιι good letters, ond the choice os a fitt
ι mansor that place will hare no small influence that way)
