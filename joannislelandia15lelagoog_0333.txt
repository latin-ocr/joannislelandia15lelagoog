INTRODUCTION..

ι INC E the Form of Matrimonp¹ iu the common Prayer

Book bath been establilhed by acts of Parliament, there
haue been only Two Marriages of the immediate Childten
of the Crown publieklylolemuiaed within this Kingdom.
The first was tbat of the eldest Danghter of King James the
First with Fredericlr Count Palatine of the Rhine, celebrated
“ ln February 1612·13‚ when each of them were above Sixteert

Years of Age, being both born iu1596. The other was ,

that of William Suu aud Heir of Frederick-Henry Prince od
Orange with Mary eldest naugher of King Charles the anst,
⁰⁹⁰⁰ lambe? 52thhallldhtlt, Pdoe ·
bldrbteon {l Ma}z 1626, abd the Princesa wantged Seunebz

Moaths of being TeuYears old, being bom the 4tb ot '

November 1631 ⁶.

I thought proper to remark the Ages of the latter, ib that s
the Ceremonial of that Marriage, as it is termed, acquaiute
us that some Forma„ as the assdng of the Banna, tlte dis·
lbeveling of the Hait iu the Proceffion, the Wafers and
Hippocras in the Church, &e were omitted· which probably
were not observed because that Princesi, by a Protestatiou ’
interposed iu proper Time, might have vacated this Contrebia

{o that upon such a Refusal all the Solemuities, whatever - ‚

they had been, would have been of no Validlty.

Though these Marriages, for that Term may in thie Plato “

be attributed to the later Solemnity, were performed with
great Splendor and Magnificenee‚ and the Heralds attended
and performed the Fundions of their Office, yet no complete
Narrativee of the Rites used iu theat are entered iu their
Books, where there are only to be found a lbort imperfest

. Eutry

Third) with Mary Daughter of the Duke of York was privatel celebrated
