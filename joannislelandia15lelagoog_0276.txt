Dr. Langbaiue¹ to Mr. ‚Seldeu

IHtIveRymy many thanus for imparting so much (as I earn

estly dested to know) of that Scotch Copy of Chaucer,
and am glad to hear that Georgius Syncellus ts at last ar-
riv’d. The reason, whylinsetted in my last that paffage
concomiug tho judgemem oi Cambridge ιιι the case of Fryer
Ruffei, was not any concurrence or approbatiou of my own
as to the Jus divinum· but' ιιι regard yow had· ιιι yowr Hi·
stoty of tythes printed the liite Ιειιιιιὲ ot this Univerfity‚ 1
conceiv’d‚ yow might not be unwilhng to know (as matter

offan) what Cambridge had done at the same tune, and up ,
on the same ocmsioh Ι might add upo'n' the sume account,
what Ι have mett within out old Registers‚ that when that
controversie was so can ted the Univers ty requir'd bya spe-
cial statute of Ptoceeders here an abj uration of the opio-011
of Ruffei; which statute andoath was afterwards ιιι Edw 6ffi’s.
time expressiy abrogated.

1 am very sorry to hear of the death ‘of My. Patrick Youn'g,
in whom 1. have not ouoly lost n fi tend whom I highly va
lued, but the pubhck more. Ιι ts uot unknown to yowrseif,
that he had for many years been agatherete (e specially out
of Greek MSS.) and had tranictib d many things not fin to
be lost. He had aimost promised me to settle himself here at
Oxford, and to set about the priuting of the rest, after ho
had fiuiih'd his LXX. aud ιι grievest nte ιο thinke

- tot congestos uot‘iesque difflue labores ·

He hts told me some umes that his Vatious Leffinnu and
Notes upon the LXX. would rise to as great a bulk, as the
Γ ext it seif. 1 beseech yoW‚ Sir, by the love oi Learuing to
be a means, that they may not all dye with him.

Ι send now the produ& of two weeks, the iheets K aud L
